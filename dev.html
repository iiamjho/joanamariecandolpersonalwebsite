The one who is <br> holding me is my mom. I was born in Cavite City on the <br> 30<sup>th</sup>, December of 1998. In this picture, we are at <br> Pangasinan City the home town of my mom. </p> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

In my former school in my elementary days, the <br> principal there always wanted me to sing whenever there <br> is a school activity. I don't know what happened today, <br> that people doesn't want me to sing anymore. </p> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

As you can see, <br> I've also experienced being "jeje", as what they call <br> nowadays. But see the first picture? It was my <br> recognition day and I was awarded as the top 1 of our <br> class. Today as I've reminisce the way I posed and <br> dressed before, I can't help but to laugh so hard.</p> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

Because in this stage I've learned how to make <br> lies to my parents just for me to be able to go to the <br> mall with my friends. In this stage, I am starting to <br> become aware of what is happening within myself and<br>around me. </p> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> </font>

In this stage, stress <br> is very prone in me but I think that's just normal because <br> I am starting to adjust to adulthood which means more <br> weighed things, experiences and challenges are waiting <br>for me. Today, I am really enjoying my life because I know <br> that I cannot turn back time but hence, I am indeed proud <br> that my parents was successful in nurturing me because <br> I've grown into a young lady that is goal-oriented, god-fearing and responsible. </p> <br> <br> <br> <br>
